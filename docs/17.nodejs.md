## Nodejs

-   Javascript outside of the browser
-   Nodejs is a Javascript Runtime built on Google's OpenSource V8 Javascript Engine.
-   Why? To access File System, Better Networking capabilities, built webservers in javascript which are fast, scalable.
-   Nodejs is single threaded, based on event-driven, non-blocking I/O Model, which makes us built fast and highly scalable data-intensive applications.
-   JavaScript across entire stack.
-   NPM: highe library of opensource packages for free
-   Use Case:
    -   Building Servers-side Web Applications
    -   Builiding APIs with database behind it.
    -   Data Streaming
    -   Real Time chat application(Web Sockets)
-   Don't use Node
    -   Application with heavy Server-Side Processing (CPU-intensive) like headvy image-preocessing, video-conversion, file-compression.
    -   Use Ruby on Rails, PHP or Python for it.
-   Error-first callbacks in Node
    -   using fs Module to read and Write Files Synchronously or Asynchronously.
    -   Callback Hell, solutions: Promises and Async Await.
-   http createServer, listen on it.
-   Routing
    -   res.end()
    -   res.writeHead(statusCode, moreHeaderObj)

## Webdev summary -

-   deploy it on the internet, there are a few ways -

    -   Go to aws, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare
    -   Rent a VM (Virtual Machine) and deploy your app
    -   Put it in an Auto scaling group
    -   Deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster

-   There are a few downsides to doing this -

    -   Taking care of how/when to scale
    -   Base cost even if no one is visiting your website
    -   Monitoring various servers to make sure no server is down

-   Serverless Backend

    -   "Serverless" is a backend deployment in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. The term "serverless" doesn't mean there are no servers involved. Instead, it means that developers and operators do not have to worry about the servers.
    -   There are many famous backend serverless providers - - AWS Lambda - Google Cloud Functions - Cloudflare Workers
    -   Cloudflare (doesn't use node.js runtime, implements its own, via isolates), wrangler(cloudflare CLI) Hono,js
