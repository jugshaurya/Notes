  - Problem Solving Strategy
  - Self Confidence
- Turn your interview into a repeatable system.
- 6 step system for solving any coding interview question, even if I‚Äôve never seen it before
- prematurely optimizing our code actually hurts us more than it helps
- The 3 ‚Äúhail mary‚Äù strategies to use when you‚Äôre really stuck
- How to avoid your mind going blank when facing a hard problem

- Simulate real-world interview 
- ‚óè Handwrite code 
- ‚óè Talk out loud as you go 
- ‚óè Test your code by hand 
- ‚óè Apply the strategies

- Make sure that you really know what is being asked. Take your time here. 
- Go through the example inputs and outputs. How does the input get that output? 
- 2. Find a brute force solution [5 minutes] 
- 3. Optimize your solution [15 minutes] 
- 4. Code your solution [15 minutes] 
- When you get to coding, it should just be ‚Äútranslating‚Äù the work you‚Äôve already done 
- 5. Test your solution [5 minutes]
- Your interviewer wants to help you
  - ‚óã The toughest interviews are when I try to help someone and they won‚Äôt let me. Don‚Äôt try to prove yourself
