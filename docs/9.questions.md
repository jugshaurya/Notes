## Questions on Byte by Byte

- The #1 reason why people fail interviews is lack of confidence!
  - Nervousness == Lack of confidence
  - Forgetting stuff == Lack of confidence
  - Memorizing == Lack of confidence

- 3 pillars of Interviewing along with consistent Practise:
  - CS Fundamentals 
  - Problem Solving Strategy
  - Self Confidence
- Turn your interview into a repeatable system.
- 6 step system for solving any coding interview question, even if I’ve never seen it before
- prematurely optimizing our code actually hurts us more than it helps
- The 3 “hail mary” strategies to use when you’re really stuck
- How to avoid your mind going blank when facing a hard problem
- "go to interview thinking you are the answer to their problem.” - George Clooney
- The best interviewees are good at problem-solving. Not pattern recognition
- treat each hint as a small deduction because They may be trying to guide you away from common pitfalls
- impostor syndrome: Everyone is way better/smarter than me.
- If you practice hard problems, then your interview will be easy by comparison
- You don’t know if you’re ready or not until you try
- If you mess up, you can always interview again in the future
- Brainstorm edge cases at the beginning and define assumptions

- What are the goals of practicing? - ○ Simulate real-world interview - ○ Identify and improve weaknesses - ○ Become comfortable with the tools and systems - ○ Avoid Rehashing what you’re already good at

- Simulate real-world interview 
- ● Handwrite code 
- ● Talk out loud as you go 
- ● Test your code by hand 
- ● Apply the strategies 
- 1. Understand the problem [3-5 minutes] 
- Make sure that you really know what is being asked. Take your time here. 
- Go through the example inputs and outputs. How does the input get that output? 
- 2. Find a brute force solution [5 minutes] 
- 3. Optimize your solution [15 minutes] 
- 4. Code your solution [15 minutes] 
- When you get to coding, it should just be “translating” the work you’ve already done 
- 5. Test your solution [5 minutes]
- Your interviewer wants to help you
  - ○ The toughest interviews are when I try to help someone and they won’t let me. Don’t try to prove yourself
  - ● Only your interviewer really knows what they are looking for
  - ● It’s an easy way to get them to like you

- Interview practice
	- ○ Pramp
	- ○ Gainlo
	- ○ Interviewing.io

- Other practice
	- ○ Toastmasters
	- ○ Wedding toasts
	- ○ Video yourself
	- ○ Actual interviews

```
After a week or two (if they don’t email)
Reply to the previous email:
Hey FIRSTNAME -
Hope all is well with you. I hadn’t heard back from you so I just wanted to check in and see if there was any more progress on my interview feedback.
Thanks!
```

```
Just wanted to bump this up in your inbox in case you missed it. Would love to discuss X.
```

- Research the company
- Prepare a short description of each major project

- How to structure your answers 
	- ● The STAR technique 
		- ● Situation (1-2 sentences) 
		- ● Task (1 sentence) 
		- ● Action (3-5 sentences) 
		- ● Result (3-5 sentences)

## Questions on Referral

- Ask what works they do. means know their work
- STAR Method
	- Situation -What Happended?
	- Task - What was your job?
	- Action - what did you do?
	- Result - So what?

## Questions on Other Tips

- Do Time Management -> based on the score of questions
- Problem Statement
- Input
- Output
- Explanation (optional/maybe given, maybe not)
- Constraints
