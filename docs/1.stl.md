-   `Containers`

    -   **Simple/Sequence Containers**

        -   `vector`, `list`, `pair`, `forward_list` (singly linked list)

    -   **Container Adapter/ Derived Containers**

        -   Don't support iterators, hence to print the content, use while(!container.empty()) thing.
        -   (build upon simple containers)
        -   (`stack`, `queue`, `deque`, `heap`, `priority queue`)

    -   **Associative Containers**

        -   Implemented as a sorted Data structure; data can be searched in O(logn)
        -   `set`, `map`, `multimap`, and `multiset`
        -   ordered map/set have an order and are implemented as self-balancing BST(Red black Trees).
        -   Keys may not need to be integral.
        -   Requirement: operator `<` should be defined.

    -   **unordered Associative Containers**
        -   Implement an unordered Data structure; data can be searched in O(1) on avg.
        -   `unordered_set`, `unordered_map`, `unordered_multimap`, `unordered_multiset`
        -   unordered map/set uses hashing and has no-ordering.

-   `Algorithms`

    -   binary_search()
    -   find()
    -   reverse()
    -   sort()
    -   and more...

-   `Iterators` (only 5 types)

    -   An object(like a pointer) that points to an element in the container, helps in accessing data within the container.
    -   We use an iterator to move through elements of the container.
    -   `Random access iterators` are like pointers like we do arithmetic on the pointer(so we can jump via these iterators).
    -   `Forward`, `Bidirectional`, `Input`, and `Output` iterators only move one at a time(+1, ++) and are not like pointers.
    -   Why use them: Iterators help in moving inside the container irrespective of the type of container, whether it is a map, set, vector, list...

-   `Comparator/Functor/Comparison object`
    -   helps in writing our comparison function that can be passed to algorithms to make comparisons
    -   It is an object(cmp) of a class that has `() operator` overloaded so to call comparison using cmp(Obj A, Obj B).

```cpp
// Example: Template + Iterator + Comparator

// generic function to find something in a container
template<class Iterator, class T, class Comparator>
Iterator search(Iterator start, Iterator end, T key, Comparator cmp ){
  // Iterator - Thanks to iterator, to work irrespective of Container.
  while(start != end){
    if(cmp(*start, key)){ // Thanks to Generic Comparator
      return start;
    }
    start++;
  }
  return end;
}

class Phone{
  string name;
  float price;
  public:
    Phone(){
    }
    Phone(string name, float price){
      this->name = name;
      this->price = price;
    }
};

class PhoneComparator{
  bool operator()(Phone A,  PhoneB){
    return A.price == B.price;
  }
};

int main(){
  Phone OnePlus("OnePlus", 100);
  Phone Xiaomi("Xiaomi", 2000);

  PhoneComparator cmp;

  vector<Phone> cv;
  cv.push_back(OnePlus);
  cv.push_back(Xiaomi);
  auto it = search(cv.begin(), cv.end(), OnePlus, cmp);
  if(it == cv.end()){
    cout<<"Phone Not Found in vector";
  }else{
    cout<<"Phone Found in vector: "<<it->name<<endl;
  }

  list<Phone> phoneList; // independent of Container- Thanks to Iterator.
  phoneList.push_back(OnePlus);
  phoneList.push_back(Xiaomi);
  auto it = search(phoneList.begin(), phoneList.end(), OnePlus, cmp);
  if(it == phoneList.end()){
    cout<<"Phone Not Found in list";
  }else{
    cout<<"Phone Found in list: "<<it->name<<endl;
  }
}

```

:::caution Note

-   **All STL containers are passed by value**.
-   So make sure to use **`&`** in formal parameters in case you want to reflect changes done inside function into STL container.

:::

### Vector<T\>

-   Dynamic Size
-   Rich Library functions
-   Easy to know size via `size()`
-   No need to pass size to function
-   Can be returned from the function
-   Initialized with default values
-   Can easily copy a vector to another via v1 = v2
-   Passed by value to function. so if you want to modify the vector make sure to use & and make the vector pass by reference.

```cpp
  vector<int> v;
  // vector size
  v.size();
  // looping over vector
  for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i){
    cout<<v[i]<<" ";
  }

  // looping(no updation) via for each loop
  for (auto x: v){
    x+=10; // will not modify vector
    cout<<x<<" ";
  }
  // looping(`updation => use reference`) via for each loop
  for (auto &x: v){ // & also help in avoiding copying larger objects.
    x+=10; // will `modify` vector
    // cout<<x<<" ";
  }
  // looping via iterator
  vector<int>::iterator vit;
  for(vit=v.begin(); vit!=v.end(); vit++){
    cout<<*vit<<" ";
  }
  // vector initialization
  vector<int> vec= {10,20,30,40};
  vector<int> vec{10,20,30,40}; // no equal sign
  vector<int> vec2(10,5) // 10 elements each with 5 value
```

-   functions same as c++ strings, almost all. see in my [cpp blog](2.cpp.md)
-   Internal Implementation be like

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    class Vector {
      int *arr;
      int num_elements;
      int capacity;

    public:
      Vector(int size) {
        arr = new int[size];
        num_elements = 0;
        capacity = size;
      }
      void insert(int val) {
        if(num_elements < capacity) {
            arr[num_elements]=val;
            num_elements++;
        } else {
            resize();
            arr[num_elements]=val;
            num_elements++;
        }
      }

      int getAt(int index){
        return arr[index];
      }

      void resize() {
        int* tempArr=new int[capacity*2];
        capacity*=2;

        for(int i=0; i<num_elements; i++) {
            tempArr[i]=arr[i];
        }

        delete [] arr;
        arr=tempArr;
      }

      int length() {
        return num_elements;
      }

      void print() {
        for(int i=0; i<num_elements; i++)
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        cout << endl;
      }
    };
    ```

:::danger

**Very Important:**

-   v.size() returns an unsigned integer.
-   So if `size is 0` and we do `v.size() - i`, it will be 0 - i.
-   => a very big positive number( >10<sup>9</sup> in 32 bit and >10<sup>18</sup> in 64 bit)
-   => loop runs for a very long time.
-   so always do `int(v.size())` to get 0-1 = -1 and not `all 1s` in unsigned interger which becomes 2^31-1 or 2^63-1.
-   or never subtract anything from v.size() at all.

:::

### list<T\> and forward-list<T\>

-   you can not call sort(l.begin(), l.end()) because sort required random access iterator but l.begin() or l.end() returns bidirectional iterators.
-   Instead `use l.sort()` to sort.

```cpp

list<int> l{2,3,4,5,5}; // doubly linked list
  /*
  methods available:-
  - l.push_back()
  - l.push_front()
  - l.pop_back()
  - l.pop_front()
  - l.remove(val)
  - l.erase(iterator)
  - l.insert(iterator, value)
  - l.sort()
  - l.reverse()
  - l.empty()
  - l.front()
  - l.back()
 */

forward_list<int> fl; // singly linked list
```

### deque<T\>

-   can use deque always instead of stack and queue.
-   O(1) random access to any element.

**Very Important**

-   **Even though it is a queue, random access is possible in the case of the deque.**
-   **=> can access dq[i] in constant time.**

```cpp
deque<int> dq;
dq.push_front(10);
dq.pop_front(20);
dq.push_back(10);
dq.pop_back(10);

// random acess iterator
deque<int> dq;
dq.push_back(10);
dq.push_back(20);
dq.push_back(30);
dq.push_back(40);
dq.push_back(50);
dq.push_back(60);

cout<< dq[3] <<endl;
cout<< dq.at(4) <<endl;
```

### Stack<T\>

-   A Container Adapter that uses deque as underline container.
-   No random Access, No iterators, No range-based loops, No curly braced-initialization.
-   inside <stack\>

    -   push()
    -   top()
    -   pop()
    -   size()
    -   empty()

    ```cpp
    stack<int> s;
    s.push(90);

    // use while stack is not empty loop to print the stack.
    auto scopy = s;
    while(!scopy.empty()){
      cout<<scopy.top()<<" ";
      scopy.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    ```

### Queue<T\>

-   A Container Adapter based on deque as well.
-   No random Access,No iterators, No range-based loops, No curly braced-initialization.
-   inside <queue\>

    -   queue<int\> q;
    -   push()
    -   pop()
    -   empty()
    -   size()
    -   front()
    -   back()

-   Internals of Queue
-   Intitally queue has front and rear pointers both points to -1 => Queue is empty.
-   Both rear and front points to same index (not equal to -1) => Queeu has only one elements.
-   Queue Full condition => rear + 1 = front.

```cpp
void enqueue(queue, front, rear, item){
  // check for full quuee
  if((rear + 1) % n == front) {
    cout<<"overflow";
    return;
  }

  if(rear == -1){
    front = rear = 0;
  }else{
    rear = (rear + 1) % n
  }
  queue[rear] = item;
}
```

```cpp
void dequeue(queue, front, rear, item){
  // check for empty quuee
  if(rear == front and rear==-1) {
    cout<<"underflow";
    return;
  }

  if(rear == front){
    front = rear = -1;
  }else{
    front = (front + 1) % n;
  }
}
```

### Priority Queue<T\> or Heap

-   Inside <queue\> header file only
-   A priority queue is just like a normal queue data structure except that each element inserted is associated with a “priority”.
-   It supports the usual push(), pop(), top(), etc operations, but is specifically designed so that its first element is always the greatest of the elements it contains, i.e. **max heap**.
-   In STL, priority queues take three template parameters:
    ```cpp
    template <class T, class Container = vector<T\>, class Compare = less<typename Container::value_type>>
    class priority_queue;
    ```
    -   The first element of the template defines the class of each element. It can be user-defined classes or primitive data types. Like in your case it can be int, float, or double.
    -   The second element defines the container to be used to store the elements. The standard container classes std::vector and std::dequeue fulfill these requirements. It is usually the vector of the class defined in the first argument. Like in our case it can be `vector<int>, vector<float>, vector<double>`.
    -   The third element is a comparative class. By default, it is `less<T>` but can be changed to suit your need. For min heap, it can be changed to `greater<T>`.
-   using vector as the underline container
    -   `priority_queue<int> pq;` <!-- default is max heap -->
    -   `priority_queue<int, vector<int> , greater<int\> > pq;` <!-- min heap -->
    -   push() => O(logn)
    -   pop() => O(logn)
    -   top() => O(1)
    -   empty() => O(1)
    -   size() => O(1)

:::info

**Important**

-   Use this ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇
-   `pqmax pq(arr, arr+n)` - => creates a max heap from an array rather than pushing elements one by one. - **Inplace Algorithm to convert the array into a heap** - 2 ways, `Top-down`, and `Bottom-up`. - Top-down is unoptimized, and bottom-up is optimized.

          :::note Top-Down Approach
            - start from the left of the array and keep on making the array till ith index as the heap.
            - Time Complexity.
              - For h=1, operations = 1
              - For h=2, operations = 2*1 (for both nodes at h=2, at max need to move 1 step above,i.e. the top)
              - For h=3, operations = 4*2 (for both nodes at h=3, at max need to move 2 step above,i.e. the top)
              - For h=4, operations = 8*3 (for both nodes at h=4, at max need to move 3 step above,i.e. the top)
              - and so on...
              - For h=h, operations = 2^(h-1) * h
              - Total = Σ (h\*2<sup>(h-1)</sup>)
              - It is an AGP.
              - = 2 + n*(logn-1)= **O(nlogn)**.
              - Solved by hand.❤️️
          :::

          :::note Bottom-up Approach
            - This approach is better as the time complexity to build a heap is O(n).
            - It builds heap using a bottom-up approach which is O(n).
            - It does it by going backward from the last internal node of the array floor(n/2) and calls heapify(i).
            - **Proof:** Let Tree is Perfect tree, which is also a CBT right? Yes. -
            - Every Perfect tree is a CBT.
            - => all internal nodes are till height (h-1).
            - and all leave nodes are at height h. If we look what we are doing.

            ```cpp
              for every node from floor(n/2) to 1:
                heapify(node)
            ```
            - Assuming heights start from 1.
            - We can say for nodes at height h-1 [#nodes = 2<sup>h-2</sup>], we call heapify at max 1 time only.
            - For nodes at height h-2 [#nodes = 2<sup>h-3</sup>]. We call heapify at max 2 times only and so on.
            - Worst case Time will be 2<sup>h-2</sup> + 2<sup>h-3</sup>\*2 + 2<sup>h-4</sup>\*3 + ....
            - = 2<sup>h-2</sup> * (1 + 2/2<sup>1</sup> + 3/2<sup>2</sup> + 4/2<sup>3</sup> + ...)
            - Also we know total number of nodes = n = 2<sup>h</sup> - 1
            - and (1 + 2/2<sup>1</sup> + 3/2<sup>2</sup> + 4/2<sup>3</sup> + ...) is approximately 3.
            - Hence, **Time Complexity is O(n)**.
          :::

    :::

:::tip

-   Furthermore, approach of pushing elements one by one is costlier and it will be O(nlogn) , log(i) being for each insertion, similar when printing heap, nlogn time.
-   In CBT, total number of internal nodes are floor(n/2)
-   It also implies leaves start from the floor(n/2) + 1 and go till n.

:::

**Custom Sorting in PQ**

-   Have to use Comparator class/struct and implement () opearator

```cpp
  struct PairCmp {
    bool operator()(Pair a , Pair b) {
      return a.second > b.second;
    }
  };

  priority_queue<Pair, vector<Pair>, PairCmp> pq;
  pq.push({100, 20});
  pq.push({150, 200});
  pq.push({190, 120});
  pq.push({110, 1340});
  pq.push({90, 10});

  while(!pq.empty()){
    cout<<pq.top().first<<","<<pq.top().second<<endl;
    pq.pop();
  }
```

::: Tip

-   We can push -ve of number in heap, to make default maxheap -> minheap.
-   If we are inserting a pair<int, int>{a,b} into maxheap, we can get anyorder, by pushing and poping any combination. using
-   {a, b} ---> order will be [desc by a, desc by b]
-   {a, -b} ---> order will be [desc by a, asc by b]
-   {-a, b} ---> order will be [asc by a, desc by b]
-   {-a, -b} ---> order will be [asc by a, asc by b]

### set<T\>

-   inside #include<set\>
-   uses RBTree as a data structure.

```cpp
  insert() // logn
  find() // logn
    - to check if the element is present or not.
    - returns iterator if found else return end() iterator.
  count() // logn
    - returns 1 or 0
    - can be used in place of find()
  size() // O(1)
  erase() // logn
  clear()
  begin() // O(1)
  end() // O(1)
  empty() // O(1)
  // as elements are sorted in set
  // it has binarysearch functions.
  lower_bound() // logn
    - returns Iterator pointing to first element equal to or greater than key, or end(). This function returns the first element of a subsequence of elements that matches the given key. If unsuccessful it returns an iterator pointing to the first element that has a greater value than the given key or end() if no such element exists.
    - always returns first element >= key, so if we want to find < key, we do lower_bound() - 1`**
  upper_bound() // logn
    - always returns first element > key, so if we want to find <= key, we do upper_bound() - 1`
    - returns the upper element.
    - Iterator pointing to the first element greater than key, or end().
```

:::caution

**Note for lower and upper bound functions**

-   If you are doing -1 (it--).
-   Make sure returned iterator doesn't points to begin().
-   If you are doing +1 (it++).
-   Make sure returned iterator doesn't points to end() or rbegin().

:::

-   `Always sorted output` when print.
-   can make `decreasing using set<int, greater<int> > s;`
-   `No Duplicates` are stored.
-   All begin() and end() access containers can use short for-loop `for (auto &x: set_name)` for printing/
-   as well as for loop with iterators.

```cpp
  // we can initialize the set with vector
  vector<int> v={1,3,5,67,8,3,2};
  set<int> s(v.begin(), v.end());
```

```cpp
  // Set for custom datatypes
  struct Person{
    string name;
    bool operator < (Person other) {
      return this->name < other.name; // lexiographically sorted increasing order
    }
  };

  set<Person> s;
  s.insert({"shaurya"});
  s.insert({"priyansh"});
  for(auto person: s){
    cout<<person.name<<endl;
  }
```

-   Application of set
    -   Store a stream of data in a sorted way.

:::tip

**Very+Most Important:**

-   Set can not update an element.
-   It have to delete the old val and insert the new val.
-   let say set<pair<int,int> > already has pair<40,30>,
-   now I want to change value to <40,100>.
-   Then I have to find pair <40,30> using auto it = set.find({40,30}),
-   erase it set.erase(it).
-   and then insert the new val set.insert({40,100});

:::

### map <T,U>

-   inside #include<map\>
-   uses RBTree as a data structure.
-   map<int, int> m;

-   operator[] (logn)

    -   to modify and create a key-value pair
    -   m[20] is used to access key 20, if key is not present, it inserts 20 with 0 in case of value being int. other way is count(key)

-   count(key) to see if it is present or not.
    -   if present then use [] to access or modify
    -   else don't.

```cpp
  insert(make_pair(key,value)) or insert({key,value})
  find() // logn
  count() // logn
  erase() // logn
  clear() // O(n) for cleanup
  size() // O(1)
  begin() // O(1)
  end() // O(1)
  empty() // O(1)
  lower_bound() // logn
  upper_bound() // logn
```

-   `Always sorted output` when print.
-   can make `decreasing using map<int, string, greater<int\> > m;`
-   `No Duplicates` are stored.
-   All begin() and end() access containers can use short for-loop `for (auto &x: map_name)` for printing, x is a pair.
-   as well as for loop with iterators.
-   Application same as set.
    -   Sorted Stream of data with key value pairs

:::tip Tips and Tricks:

-   Always use map instead of unordered_map as map guarantees to have operations in log(n) time.
-   but unordered_map can in the worst case goes to O(n).
-   So using map inside for(1..n) loop can result in n<sup>2</sup> rather than nlogn.
-   But if you get TLE from map. replace map with unordered_map and try to submit.

:::

### unordered_set <T\>

-   inside #include<unordered_set>
-   uses Hashing as the data structure.
-   no ordering here.
-   for loop gives unpredicted output.
-   insert()
-   find()
-   count()
-   size()
-   empty()
-   clear()
-   erase()
-   **All operations are constant O(1) on average**.

```cpp
  unordered_set<int> us; // uses hashing
  us.insert(109);
  us.insert(10);
  us.insert(9);
  // printing
  for (auto x: us){
    cout<<x<<" ";
  }
  // or
  for (auto it = us.begin(); it!=us.end(); it++){
    cout<<(*it)<<" ";
  }
```

### unordered_map<T,U>

-   inside #include<unordered_map\>
-   uses Hashing as the data structure.
-   no ordering here.
-   for loop gives unpredicted output.
-   insert() or operator[].
-   find()
-   count()
-   size()
-   empty()
-   clear()
-   erase()
-   **All operations are constant O(1) on average**.

```cpp
  unordered_map<int, bool> um; // uses hashing
  um.insert({109, true});
  um.insert({9, false});
  um.insert({10, true});
  // printing
  for (auto x: um){
    cout<<x.first<<","<<x.second<<" ";
  }
  // or
  for (auto it = um.begin(); it!=um.end(); it++){
    cout<<(*it).first<<","<<(*it).second<<" ";
  }

```

-   similarly multiset inside #include<set\>
-   similarly multimap inside #include<map\>
-   For Multiset
    -   `st.erase(val)` will delete all occurences of val from multiset.
    -   but to remove **only a single val**, even if multiple exist use have to use `st.erase(st.find(val))`.

### STL Algorithms (More Useful Functions)

```cpp
- INT_MAX, LONG_MAX, LLONG_MAX // (in #include<climits\>)
- INT_MIN, LONG_MIN, LLONG_MIN // (in #include<climits\>)
- int max()
- int min()
- void swap(a,b)

:::note Tip

-   Use member functions of the container if available rather than using global ones. Those are more optimized and correct.
-   Like use lower_bound of set on set(set.lower_bound(key)) rather than using lower_bound(set.begin(), set.end(), key) as set does not have random iterator.
