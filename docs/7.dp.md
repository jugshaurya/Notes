#### DP

## Dynamic Programming (DP)

-   All about remembering the past.
-   `Optimal Substructure`
    -   Can express bigger problem in small sub-problems of the same type (Recurrence Relation).
    -   This property is also available in Divide and Conquer, all recursion problems.
-   `Overlapping Subproblem`
    -   This property is the giveaway that the given problem is a DP problem.
-   states
    -   #states are is basically DP array size.
-   Transitions
    -   Transitions means number of recursive calls.
-   what does dp(states) represent?
-   Base Cases: Basically when/where does your transition equation fails?
-   `Estimated` Time complexity of DP problems = `#states * (1 + Average cost of transitions)`
-   `Exact` Time complexity of DP problems = `Total transition time for all states.`
-   Space complexity of DP problems = `#states * space required for each state`
-   Cost of Transition = extra time taken besides recusive calls.
-   ⭐ In DP problems, we need to think/practise finding states(both form and constraints) and transitions needed to solve the problem.

| Recursive                              | Iterative                                                                                                       |

| No need to care about the flow         | Important to calculate states in a way that <br/> current state can be derived from previously calculated state |
| ⭐ Doesn't evaluate unnecessary states | All states are evaluated.                                                                                       |

## Some Initialization Points

---

```cpp
  // In global scope
  vector<int> dp;
  int n;

  void solve (){
    // resetting dp array for every test case
    dp.clear();
    dp.resize(n);
    dp.assign(n,0); // or dp = vector<int>(n,0);
  }

  int main(){
    int t; cin>>t; while(t--) solve();
  }
```

### General structure of DP functions

---

```cpp
int dp[N][M]; // dp array
// function with state and constraints
// In knapsack,
// form state:  the index we are currently working in our problem.
// constraint state:  W, we cannot go above bags Weight.
function rec (<form state(s)>, <constraint state(s)>){
  // Pruning cases
  // Base cases
  // cache check
  // recursive code and computation
  // save and return
}
```
