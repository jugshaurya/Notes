## Number System

-   Any Composite number can be written as the product of its prime factors.
  -   Eg: 240 = 2<sup>4</sup> _3<sup>1</sup>_ 5<sup>1</sup>
  -   Eg: N = a<sup>p</sup> _q<sup>q</sup>_ r<sup>r</sup>
-   Factors of 240 are (2<sup>0</sup>,2<sup>1</sup>,2<sup>2</sup>,2<sup>3</sup>,2<sup>4</sup>)_(3<sup>0</sup>,3<sup>1</sup>)_(5<sup>0</sup>,5<sup>1</sup>).
-   Sum of factors of 240 are (2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>)_(3<sup>0</sup> + 3<sup>1</sup>)_(5<sup>0</sup> + 5<sup>1</sup>).
-   Total #factors(TF) = #primeFactors + #compositeFactors + 1(NPNC) 
  -   #factors of 120 = 3 + 12 + 1 = 16 
-   Total #factors(TF) = `(p+1)*(q+1)*(r+1)` = 5*2*2 = 20
-   Total Number of Even Factors(e) = `(p)*(q+1)*(r+1)`
-   Total Number of odd Factors = TF - e
-   Product of Factors
  -   n<sup>(TF/2)</sup> = 240<sup>(20/2)</sup> = 240<sup>10</sup>.
  -   n<sup>(TF/2)</sup> = 36<sup>(9/2)</sup> = 36<sup>4.5</sup>.

## Unit place
1. Unit place of (1! + 2! + 3! +...... + 99!) = Unit place of (1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 + 720 + ...) = 3. 
2. Last two digits of (1! + 2! + 3! +...... + 99!) = Last two digits of (1 + 2 + 6 + 24 + 120 + 720 + 5040 +  40320 +  362880 +  3628800 + ...) = 73.

## HCF/GCD and LCM

-   (a,b) are **Co-Prime** if gcd(a,b) = 1.
    -   Used in the calculation of MMI in Number Theory.
-   (a,b) are **Twin-Prime** if both a and b are prime and b-a = 2.
    -   used in the calculation of MMI in Number Theory.
-   HCF of two or more fraction
    -   HCF of Numerators / LCM of Denominators
-   LCM of two or more fraction
    -   LCM of Numerators / HCF of Denominators
-   The product of HCF and LCM is equal to product of numbers

    -   HCF(a,b) _LCM(a,b) = a_ b
    -   Applicable ONLY for 2 numbers

-   ðŸŒŸ IIT Level Notes ðŸŒŸ

    -   1. HCF and LCM of fractions
        -   HCF(a/b, c/d, e/f,...) = HCF(a,c,d)/LCM(b,d,f) = HCM(numerator)/ LCM(denominator)
        -   LCM(a/b, c/d, e/f,...) = LCM(a,c,d)/HCF(b,d,f) = LCM(numerator)/ HCF(denominator)
    -   2. HCF of two numbers will always be less than the LCM of them
        -   HCF(a,b) < LCM(a,b) ----- Always.
    -   3. Product of two numbers is equal to the product of LCM and HCF of them

        -   a*b = HCF(a,b)* LCM(a,b)
        -   Ques 1: What is the product of two numbers whose HCF is 25 and LCM is 5.
            -   Ans: Not Possible, beacuse HCF > LCM
        -   Ques 2: What is the product of two numbers whose HCF is 10 and LCM is 35.
            -   Ans: 10\*35 = 350

    -   4. Remainder Theorem
        -   Let P(x) be a polynomial. If P(x) is divided by (x-a), then the Remainder is P(a).
            -   Ex: find the Remainder when (x<sup>2</sup> + x - 1) is divisible by (x-5).
                -   Ans: P(5) = 25 + 5 - 1 = 29.
    -   5. Factor Theorem
        -   If P(x) is divisible by (x-a), then P(a) = 0.
            -   In other words, If P(x) is divisible by (x - a), then Remainder = P(a) = 0.
    -   Note: when we divide P(x) by f(x), the Remainder will always be of atleast 1 degree less than the f(x) Polynomial.

## ðŸŒŸ IIT Level Tips ðŸŒŸ

1. underroot/square root("âˆš") is a +ve quantity => âˆš16 = 4. and not Â±4.

2. âˆšx^2 = |x| = mod x = Â±x

3. âˆšf(x) exist only when f(x) â‰¥ 0

4. x^2, x^3, x^4, ... are called power functions.

    - Their values are always +ve and can be zero. i.e. x^a â‰¥ 0.

5. 2^x, 3^x, 4^x, ... are called exponential functions, and their values are always +ve and can never be zero.

-   => a^x > 0.

6. If sum of two or more +ve quantities results in zero, that implies all quantities are zero.

-   Ex. Given: âˆšx + |u| + v^2 = 0.
-   => x = 0, u = 0, v = 0

7. Quadratic Equation

-   ax^2 + bx + c > 0
    -   If a > 0 (Upward parabola) & D < 0 (no real roots)
-   ax^2 + bx + c < 0
    -   If a < 0 (Downward parabola) & D < 0 (no real roots)

8. Formula: (a^4 + a^2 + 1) = (a^2 + a + 1)(a^2 - a + 1)

9. Solving Inequalites

-   1. Factorize the given equation and find all odd powers bracket
-   2. Get values from bracket and arrange them in number line.
-   3. Find values of x for which function is not defined (even power bracket or denominator) and remove/take them.
-   4. Put +ve sign to the rightmost side and then change of sign for odd powers brackets only.
-   5. chose answer
    -   a. For > 0, >= 0, opt +ve sign
    -   b. For < 0, <= 0, opt -ve sign

10. a^3 + b^3 +c^3 - 3abc

-   = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ac)
-   = (a+b+c)((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2)/2

11. Every perfect square number is of the form:

-   4n or 4n+1
-   3n or 3n+1
-   2n(either even) or 2n+1(or odd) ðŸ˜‚

12. If LCM(a,b) = c, then c/a and c/b are both Integers

-   LCM(n!, (n+1)!) = (n+1)!
-   LCM(6,9) = 18
-   LCM(pi, pi^2) = Not possible, because if you think answer is pi^2, then pi^2/pi and pi^2/pi^2 should have been both Integers, but they are not.
-   LCM(âˆš3, âˆš6) = Not possible, same reason

13. Every Prime Number above 3 are of the form

-   6n + 1 or 6n - 1(â‰… 6n + 5)

## Ratio and Proportion

-   **Ratio** is a:b or a/b
-   **Compound Ratio**
    -   If a/b and c/d are two ratios then (ac)/(bd) is a Compound ratio.
-   **Proportion**
    -   if a/b and c/d are two ratios and they are like a/b = c/d then, both ratios are said to be in proportion.
    -   written as a:b :: c:d, where b and c are means & a and d are extremes.
    -   Product of means = Product of extremes.
-   **Continued-Proportion**

    -   If a,b,c are in continued-proop. then a:b :: b:c => b^2 = ac
    -   => any three consecutive terms of a GP are in continued Proportion.

-   ðŸŒŸ IIT Level Notes ðŸŒŸ
    -   **C & D**
        -   If(a/b) = c/d --- (1)
        -   then a/b + 1 = c/d + 1 is called Compendendo
        -   then a/b - 1 = c/d - 1 is called Dividendo
        -   and doing both is called C and D.
    -   If a/b = c/d = e/f = ... ---(2)
    -   expresion (2) = any linear Combination of Numerators / same linear Combination of Denominators
    -   Example a/b = c/d = e/f = (2a + 3c + 5e)/ (2b + 3d + 5f)
    -   Example a/b = c/d = e/f = [(a^(1/n) + c^(1/n) + e^(1/n))/ (b^(1/n) + d^(1/n) + f^(1/n))]^n
    -   proof: express (2) = k and put values to validate (k-Method)

## Logarithms

-   If loga b = x, then
-   required 3 Conditions should hold: a>0, a!=1, b>0
-   If b=0, loga b = loga 0, = -âˆž (if a>1, let a=2, then 2^(-âˆž) = 0) = Not defined.
-   If b=0, loga b = loga 0, = âˆž (if a<1, let a=0.5, then (0.5)^(âˆž) = 0) = Not defined.
-   If a=1,b=1, loga b = log1 1, = R(many answers) = Not defined.
    -   logcot45 tan45 = Not defined as base cannot be 1.
-   Properties of log(may not be known to you)
    -   Smile/muskan Theroem: loga b^c = logc b^a, if you draw the curve line b/w swapped elements, you will see a smile.
    -   a^x = e^(xlna)
    -   loga b^c = c\*loga b
    -   loga^c b = (1/c)(loga b) = base ki power 1 upon ho jayegi.
-   Logarithms of negative numbers is not defined. See the log graph.
-   Properties
    -   log 1(base a) = 0 for all a > 0 and a != 1
    -   log a(base a) = 1 for all a > 0 and a != 1
-   Number of digits in a number can be found by taking the log base 10 of that number.
    -   floor(log99(base 10) + 1) = 2.
    -   floor(log100(base 10) + 1) = 3.
-   **VVVI Imp**:
    -   In loga b,
    -   If both a and b are on same side of unity, then answer is +ve, else -ve
    -   Ex - log(2) (4) = +ve = 2
    -   Ex - log(2) (.4) = -ve = log2 (4/10) = log2 4 - log2 10 = 2 - 3.something = -ve
    -   Ex - log(.2) (4) = -ve = log(2/10) 4 = log2 4/log2 (2/10) = log2 4/(log2 2 - log2 10) = Denom is negative, num is +ve = -ve
    -   Ex - log(.2) (.4) = +ve
    -   In other words
        -   If loga b > 0
            -   => a>1 and b>1
            -   or => 0<a<1 and 0<b<1
        -   If loga b < 0
            -   => a > 1 and 0 < b < 1
            -   or => 0 < a < 1 and b > 1

-   ðŸŒŸ IIT Level Notes ðŸŒŸ

    -   **AP**
        -   last term = a + (#terms-1)\*d
        -   => number of terms(n) in AP = (l-a)/d + 1
        -   Tn means nth term
        -   Tn = a + (n - 1)d = a+nd-d
            -   => Tn is a linear function
            -   => coefficient of n is d.
        -   Arithmatic Mean = (a+b)/2
        -   ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ Inserting Arithmetic Means between numbers
            -   Let a & b are two numbers and we want to insert n means b/w them
            -   Total Numbers in the end will be n + 2.
            -   Let means be Arithmatic means. since these n+2 numbers must form an AP with first term as a and last being b.
            -   last term = a + (#terms-1)\*d
            -   b = a + (n + 1)\*d
            -   d = (b-a)/(n+1)
            -   => first term = a
            -   => second term (1st AM) = a+d = a + (b-a)/(n+1)
            -   => third term (2st AM) = a+2d = a + 2\*(b-a)/(n+1)
            -   and so on...
    -   **GP**
        -   Geometric Mean = sqrt(ab)
        -   ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ Inserting Geometric Means between numbers
            -   Let a & b are two numbers and we want to insert n means b/w them
            -   Total Numbers in the end will be n + 2.
            -   Let means be Geometric means. since these n+2 numbers must form an GP with first term as a and last being b.
            -   last term = ar^(#terms-1)
            -   b = ar^(n + 1)
            -   r = (b/a)^(1/(n+1))
            -   => first term = a
            -   => second term (1st GM) = ar = a(b/a)^(1/(n+1))
            -   => third term (2st GM) = ar^2 = a((b/a)^(1/(n+1)))^2
            -   and so on...
    -   **HP**

        -   There is no general formulas for HP. THey are found by inverting the numbers and then using AP formulas.

    -   ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ Relation b/w AM,GM,HM
        -   GM is the Geometric mean of AM and HM
            -   ðŸ˜ˆ GM = sqrt(AM\*HM)
        -   For any two numbers a &b
            -   ðŸ˜ˆ AM > GM > HM (Trick: Lexiographically decreasing)
    -   **AGP**

## Time and Distance

-   Relative Speed

    -   If two cars are moving toward/away from each other(in opposite directions), the relative speed is S1+S2
    -   If two cars are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is |S1-S2|

-   Trains

    -   case 1: Train crossing stationary object, and has no length
        -   s(train) = l(train length) / time
    -   case 2: Train crossing stationary object, and has length
        -   s(train) = l+o(train length + object length) / time
    -   case 3: Train crossing moving object, and has no length
        -   case 3a: Same direction.
            -   |s(train) - s(object)| = l(train length) / time
        -   case 3a: opposite direction.
            -   s(train) + s(object) = l(train length) / time
    -   case 4: Train crossing moving object, and has length

        -   case 3a: Same direction.
            -   |s(train) - s(object)| = l+o(train length + object length) / time
        -   case 3a: opposite direction.
            -   s(train) + s(object) = l+o(train length + object length) / time

    -   Conclusion: lengths(train and object) will always be added.
        -   All cases combined are covered in case 4. just put the length or speed of object 0 to get other cases.

-   Boats and Stream
    -   upstream :- Boat Moving opposite to the direction of stream. => speed of the boat will decrease.
        -   Boat relative Speed : s(boat) - s(stream)
    -   downstream:- Boat Moving with stream => speed of the boat will increase.
        -   Boat relative Speed : s(boat) + s(stream)

## Time and Work

-   Time is always told in hr, sec, min {hours, minutes, seconds}.
-   Work is always referred to as `efficiency` => How much thing is done in this much time.

## Data Interpretation

-   bar graph
-   line graph
-   histogram
-   polygon graph
-   tabular form
-   pie chart

## Deductive Logic Problems

-   Deriving a conclusion from single/multiple propositions is called premises.

## Functions

## Limits

-   Limit is defined at a point, if both LHL and RHL are defined and Equal.
-   7 Indeterminant Forms:-
    -   âˆž/âˆž, 0/0, 0\*âˆž, âˆž - âˆž, 1<sup>âˆž</sup>, 0<sup>0</sup>, âˆž<sup>0</sup>
-   Solving these 7 Interminant forms:-
    -   âˆž/âˆž, 0/0, 0\*âˆž, => Use Hospital's Rule
    -   âˆž - âˆž => use factorization to convert to âˆž/âˆž, 0/0, 0\*âˆž forms.
    -   1<sup>âˆž</sup> => for **lim f(x)<sup>g(x)</sup>**, use formula **e<sup> lim g(x) \* [f(x) - 1]</sup>**
    -   0<sup>0</sup> or âˆž<sup>0</sup> => take log both side and solve.
