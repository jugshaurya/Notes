## CSS

-   When we define a variable on an element, it is available to all of that element's children.

````css
/* Whenever an <em> is used within a paragraph, it'll have a yellow background. */
p {
    --highlight-color: yellow;
}

em {
    background: var(--highlight-color);
}

/* This variable will be available everywhere, because every element is a descendant of the HTML tag: */
/* :root is a reference to the top-level element. It's equivalent to the html selector. */
html {
  --color-red: hsl(0deg 80% 50%);
  --color-blue: hsl(270deg 75% 60%);
}

:root {
  --color-red: hsl(0deg 80% 50%);
  --color-blue: hsl(270deg 75% 60%);
}
/* Both are same */


*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

``

- Custom properties need to start with two dashes. This is what differentiates them from traditional CSS properties.
- They can hold any type of value, not just colors and pixels.
- You can specify a default value if the CSS variable isn't defined: var(--primary-color, pink) will fall back to pink if necessary.
- pseudo-class: targeta a specific state of element, :hover, :active, :first-child, :last-child
- pseudo-element: targets a sub-elements within an element., ::placeholder, ::after, ::before.
- > : Direct child.
- space: inside.

#### Questions

-   One way binding vs two way binding?
-   How Virtual Dom Actually works?

-   Builds Single Page Application
-   Virtual DOM
-   React is Declarative
-   React is component based
-   set of immutable values are passed to the components.(properties flow down; actions flow up.)
-   Composition and not Inheritance.
-   Hooks are more restrictive than regular functions. You can only call Hooks at the top level of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

## React Notes

-   A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces.
-   **React is Declarative**
-   Composition over Inheritance.
-   React is just Javascript.
-   Component-Based.

    -   Components represent the modularity and reusability of React.
    -   Components should follow the single responsibility principle(from SOLID Principle) and just "do one thing".

-   Composition is:

    -   Function composition is a mathematical concept that allows you to combine two or more functions into a new function.(_fog(x) and gof(x)_)
    -   React makes use of the power of composition, heavily! React builds up pieces of a UI using components. Let's take a look at some pseudo code for an example. Here are three different components:

    ```html
    <Page>
        <article />
        <Sidebar />
    </Page>
    ```

-   Can write directly on codepen
    -   create a new pen, add react, reactDOM, babel CDN
    -   jsbin, script tag with text/babel and then write JSX.

    -   Vue
    -   Angular
    -   Backbone
    -   Ember

-   CRA(create-react-app) (A build Workflow)

    -   optimizes code
    -   can use latest javascript features / syntax.
    -   yarn / npm + webpack bundler + babel transpiler + webpack dev server + hot reloading + many more...

-   Container / stateful / smart Components
-   Component / stateless / dumb / presentational Components
-   Controlled / UnControlled Form Inputs
-   `props` represent "read-only" data that are immutable.
-   `state`, represents mutable data that ultimately affects what is rendered on the page. State is managed internally by the component itself and is meant to change over time, commonly due to user input (e.g., clicking on a button on the page).

-   JSX is awesome, but it does need to be transpiled into regular JavaScript before reaching the browser(means during compilation stage). We typically use a transpiler like Babel to accomplish this for us. We can run Babel through a build tool, like Webpack which helps bundle all of our assets (JavaScript files, CSS, images, etc.) for web projects.

-   To streamline these initial configurations, we can use Facebook's Create React App package to manage all the setup for us! This tool is incredibly helpful to get started in building a React app, as it sets up everything we need with zero configuration! Install Create React App (through the command-line with npm), and then we can walk through what makes it so great.

-   Yarn is a package manager that's similar to NPM. Yarn was created from the ground up by Facebook to improve on some key aspects that are slow or lacking in NPM.

-   **Facebook's create-react-app** is a command-line tool that scaffolds a React application. Using this, there is no need to install or configure module bundlers like Webpack, or transpilers like Babel. These come preconfigured (and hidden) with create-react-app, so you can jump right into building your app!

-   React encourages us to build applications using _composition instead of inheritance_.

    -   we need to extend React.Component, but we never extend it more than once. Instead of extending base components to add more UI or behavior, we compose elements in different ways using nesting and props. You ultimately want your UI components to be independent, focused, and reusable.

-   In a blog post, written by Facebook they had mentioned that they had never used Inheritance in their React code across thousands of components. This shows how just using Composition can solve code reuse problems in React.

-   This process of determining what has changed in the previous and new outputs is called **Reconciliation**.

-   For all Components, its **UI = f(state)**. <!-- Your UI is just a function of your state -->

-   **IMP:** Functions that are updating the state(let x) in some way must reside in x-state component, not in children or parent.

-   **Type checking a Component's Props with PropTypes**

    -   As we implement additional features into our app, we may soon find ourselves debugging our components more frequently. For example, what if the props that we pass to our components end up being an unintended data type (e.g. an object instead of an array)? PropTypes is a package that lets us define the data type we want to see right from the get-go and warn us during **development** if the prop that's passed to the component doesn't match what is expected.
        To use PropTypes in our app, we need to install `prop-types` from npm or yarn.
    -   or Use Typescript, that does the work for proptypes and does much more.

-   useState
    -   use of Lazy Initializers
-   useEffect
-   useRef
    -   A ref is an object that stays consistent between renders of your React component. It has a current property on it which can be updated to any value at any time. In the case of interacting with DOM nodes, you can pass a ref to a React element and React will set the current property to the DOM node that's rendered.

-   useSyncExternalStore
-   useTransition
-   Custom Hooks

    -   Just the functions that use hooks inside them.
    -   always should start with `use`.

### Controlled Components Recap

-   Controlled components refer to components that render a form, but the "source of truth" for that form state lives inside of the component state rather than inside of the DOM.

#### The benefits of Controlled Components are:

-   instant input validation
-   conditionally disable/enable buttons
-   enforce input formats

![](../static/img/reactDocs/b.png)

-   In our ListContacts component, not only does the component render a form, but it also controls what happens in that form based on user input. In this case, event handlers update the component's state with the user's search query. And as we've learned: any changes to React state will cause a re-render on the page, effectively displaying our live search results.
-   **Putting it All Into Perspective**
    When it comes to keeping track of data in your app, think about what will be done with that data, and what that data will look like as your user interfaces with your app. If you want your component to store mutable local data, consider using state to hold this information. Many times, it is state that will be used to manage controlled form elements in your components.
-   On the other hand, if some information isn't expected to change over time, and is generally designed to be "read-only" throughout your app, consider using props instead. Both state and props will generally be in the form of an object, and changes in either will trigger a re-render of the component, but they each play very different roles in your app.
-   render() is only used for displaying content, we put the code that should handle things like Ajax requests in what React calls lifecycle events.

### Lifecycle Events

![](../static/img/reactDocs/c.png)

Lifecycle events are specially named methods in a component. These methods are automatically bound to the component instance, and React will call these methods naturally at certain times during the life of a component. There are a number of different lifecycle events, but here are the most commonly used ones.

> componentDidMount()
>
> > invoked immediately after the component is inserted into the DOM
> > componentWillUnmount()
>
> > invoked immediately before a component is removed from the DOM
> > getDerivedStateFromProps()
>
> > invoked after a component is instantiated as well as when it receives brand new props

-   To use one of these, you'd just create a method in your component with the name and React will call it. It's an easy way to hook into different parts of the lifecycle of React components.

-   The lifecycle event that we'll be looking at (and will be using a lot in our app!) is the **componentDidMount()** lifecycle event.

-   You'll sometimes see **shouldComponentUpdate()** in React apps as well. It returns true by default. This means that whenever a component's state (or its parent's state) is updated, the component re-renders.

-   The React documentation provides the following guidance for using this lifecycle event:

    -   The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on the default behavior.
    -   Do not rely on it to ‚Äúprevent‚Äù a rendering, as this can lead to bugs.
    -   Consider using the built-in **PureComponent** instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand.
        We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify() in shouldComponentUpdate(). It is very inefficient and will harm performance.

### Now, there are a number of different lifecycle events.

They will run at different points, but we can break them down into three distinct categories:

### 1. Adding to the DOM

The following lifecycle events will be called in order when a component is being added to the DOM:

```js
constructor();
getDerivedStateFromProps();
render();
componentDidMount();
```

‚ö†Ô∏ècomponentWillMount() has been deprecated. ‚ö†Ô∏è
As of React 16.3, componentWillMount() has been replaced with UNSAFE_componentWillMount(). Only UNSAFE_componentWillMount() will work starting with React 17.0. UNSAFE_componentWillMount() is now considered to be a legacy method and should not be used in new code.

### 2. Re-rendering

The following lifecycle events will be called in order when a component is re-rendered to the DOM:

```js
getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()(specific use cases)
componentDidUpdate()
```

‚ö†Ô∏ècomponentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() have been deprecated. ‚ö†Ô∏è
As of React 16.3, they have been replaced with UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() and UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(). Only UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() and UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() will work starting with React 17.0. UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() and UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() are now considered to be legacy methods and should not be used in new code.

### 3. Removing from the DOM

This lifecycle event is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

```js
componentWillUnmount();
```

### Single-Page Apps

-   Single-page applications can work in different ways. One way a single-page app loads is by downloading the entire site's contents all at once. This way, when you're navigating around on the site, everything is already available to the browser, and it doesn't need to refresh the page. Another way single-page apps work is by downloading everything that's needed to render the page the user requested. Then when the user navigates to a new page, asynchronous JavaScript requests are made for just the content that was requested.

-   Another key factor in a good single-page app is that the URL controls the page content. Single-page applications are highly interactive, and users want to be able to get back to a certain state using just the URL. Why is this important? Bookmarkability! (pretty sure that's not a word...yet) When you bookmark a site, that bookmark is only a URL, it doesn't record the state of that page.

### React Router

-   React Router turns React projects into single-page applications. It does this by providing a number of specialized components that manage the creation of links, manage the app's URL, provide transitions when navigating between different URL locations, and so much more.

    > According to the React Router website:

    > React Router is a collection of navigational components that composes declaratively with your application.

    ```
    npm install --save react-router-dom
    ```

#### <BrowserRouter\/>

-   going to listen for the changes in url, and make sure correct screen shows up when url changes.

-   Here is the code straight from the React Router repository.

    ```js
    class BrowserRouter extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        basename: PropTypes.string,
        forceRefresh: PropTypes.bool,
        getUserConfirmation: PropTypes.func,
        keyLength: PropTypes.number,
        children: PropTypes.node,
      };

      history = createHistory(this.props);

      render() {
        return <Router history={this.history}                  children=this.props.children} />;
      }
    }
    ```

-   When you use BrowserRouter, what you're really doing is rendering a Router component and passing it a history prop. Wait, what is history? history comes from the history library (also built by React Training). The whole purpose of this library is it abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, confirm navigation, and persist state between sessions.

-   So in a nutshell, when you use BrowserRouter, you're creating a history object which will listen to changes in the URL and make sure your app is made aware of those changes.

-   Link is a straightforward way to provide declarative, accessible navigation around your application. By passing a to property to the Link component, you tell your app which path to route to.

    ```js
    <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    ```

-   If you're experienced with routing on the web, you'll know that sometimes our links need to be a little more complex than just a string. For example, you can pass along query parameters or link to specific parts of a page. What if you wanted to pass state to the new route? To account for these scenarios, instead of passing a string to Links to prop, you can pass it an object like this,

    ```js
    <Link
        to={{
            pathname: "/courses",
            search: "?sort=name",
            hash: "#the-hash",
            state: { fromDashboard: true },
        }}
    >
        Courses
    </Link>
    ```

-   with a Route component if you want to be able to pass props to a specific component that the router is going to render, you'll need to use Route‚Äôs render prop. As you saw, render puts you in charge of rendering the component which in turn allows you to pass any props to the rendered component as you'd like.

    ```javascript

    <Route to="/" component={Alpha} />
    <Route to="/" render={(props) => <Alpha {...props} />} />

    ```

-   In summary, the Route component is a critical piece of building an application with React Router because it's the component which is going to decide which components are rendered based on the current URL path.

## React Native

## TypeScript

-   Programming languages divide into two categories: statically-typed and dynamically-typed.
-   In statically-typed languages (eg C++, C#, Java, etc), the type of variables is set at compile-time and cannot change later.
-   In dynamically-typed languages (eg Python, JavaScript, Ruby), the type of variables is determined at run-time and can change later.
-   TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with static typing and some additional features that help us write more concise and robust code.
-   Most IDEs and code editors supporting TypeScript provide incredible IntelliSense and auto-completion. So we get active hints as we code. A great productivity booster!
-   By providing type information in our code, we get better refactoring support in most IDEs and code editors.
-   With TypeScript we can catch more bugs at compile time.
-   Browsers don‚Äôt understand TypeScript code. So we need to use the TypeScript compiler to compile and translate (or transpile) our TypeScript code into regular JavaScript for execution by browsers.
-   `Source maps` are files that represent the mapping between TypeScript and JavaScript code. They‚Äôre used for debugging.
-   We can configure the TypeScript compiler by enabling/disabling various settings in tsconfig.json
-   Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, it includes all the built-in types in JavaScript (eg `number, string, boolean, object, null, undefined`) as well as additional types (eg `any, unknown, never, enum, tuple`, etc).
-   In TypeScript, we set the type of our variables by annotating them.
-   The `any` type can represent any kind of value. It‚Äôs something we should avoid as much as possible because it defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the rst place. A variable of type any can take any kind of value!
-   `Tuples` are fixed-length arrays where each element has a specific type. We often use them for representing two or three related values.
-   `Enums` represent a list of related constants.

```ts
// Annotation:
let sales: number = 123_456_789;
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

// Tuples:
let user: [number, string] = [1, "Mosh"];

// Enums:
enum Size {
    Small = 1,
    Medium,
    Large,
}
// Enum with const => generates optimized code in js file.
const enum Size2 {
    Small = 1,
    Medium,
    Large,
}

// Functions:
function calculateTax(income: number): number {
    return income * 0.2;
}

// Objects:
let employee: {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    retire: (date: Date) => void;
} = {
    id: 1,
    name: "Mosh",
    retire: (date: Date) => {},
};
```

-   Using a type alias we can create a new name (alias) for a type. We often use type aliases to create custom types.

```ts
// Type alias
type Employee = {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    retire: (date: Date) => void;
};
```

-   With union types, we can allow a variable to take one of many types (eg number | string).

```ts
// Union types
let weight: number | string = 1;
weight = "1kg";
```

-   With intersection types, we can combine multiple types into one (eg Draggable & Resizable).

```ts
// Intersection types
type Draggable = { drag: () => void };
type Droppable = { drop: () => void };

type UIWidget = Draggable & Droppable;

const MenuBox: UIWidget = {
    drag: () => {
        /* ... */
    },
    drop: () => {
        /* ... */
    },
};

// Literal types
type Quantity = 50 | 100;

// Nullable types
let name: string | null = null;
```

-   Using **optional chaining** `(?.)` we can simplify our code and remove the need for `null or undefined` checks.

```ts
// Optional chaining (?.)
customer?.birthdate?.getFullYear();
customers?.[0];
log?.("message");
```

-   Using the **Nullish Coalescing Operator** (`??`), we can fallback to a default value when dealing with `null or undefined` objects.

```ts
// Nullish coalescing operator
let speed: number | null | undefined = null;
let ride = {
  // IMPORTANT: // speed: speed || 30; // error when speed is 0 => speed will be set to 30, as 0 is falsy in JS.
sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss  // speed: speed != null ? speed : 30, // have to use this
  // Both are equivalent
  speed: speed ?? 30,
};
```

-   Sometimes we know more about the type of a variable than the TypeScript compiler. In those situations, we can use the `as` keyword to specify a different type than the one inferred by the compiler. This is called `type assertion`.
-   The `unknown` type is the type-safe version of any. Similar to any, it can represent any value but we cannot perform any operations on an unknown type without first narrowing to a more specific type.

```ts
// The unknown type
function render(document: unknown) {
    // We have to narrow down to a specific type before we can perform any operations
    // on an unknown type.
    if (typeof document === "string") {
    }

-   The `never` type represents values that never occur. We often use them to annotate functions that never returns or always throw an error.

```ts
// The never type

// This function never returns because it has an infinite loop.
function processEvents(): never {
    while (true) {}
}

function onlyThrowsError(): never {
    throw new Error("error");
}
```

## Joy of React

-   A growth mindset is the belief that our brains are elastic, that we become smarter through practice, and that failure is the fastest way to learn. This mindset is a superpower for developers.

-   Productive Failure

-   There are two exceptions to the "camelCasing" of attributes: data attributes and ARIA attributes.
-   Data attributes aren't used that often in React, but they can be helpful for labelling elements for automated testing.
-   ARIA attributes are used by assistive technologies like screen readers to improve the accessibility of our applications.

```jsx
<div
  style={{
    width: 200, // Equivalent to `width: 200px`
    paddingTop: 8, // Equivalent to `padding-top: 8px`
  }}
>
```

```jsx
<p
  style={{
    lineHeight: 20, // Equivalent to `line-height: 20`
  }}
>
```

-   aria-label only works on interactive elements like buttons.
-   The clsx function will take each of these arguments and produce a unified string that satisfies the className prop requirements. It'll automatically remove falsy values like false or null.Ultimately, it's not a game-changer, but it can be a handy little utility! It shaves off some of the rough edges of trying to construct the string ourselves.
-   Less code means less space for bugs to hide
-   updating a state variable is asynchronous. It's a scheduled update. Because state updates are asynchronous, they can be batched.
