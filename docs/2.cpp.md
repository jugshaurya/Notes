# Languages

- `C++` programs are compiled and are architectural-dependent, which means you have to compile the source code for different OS/machines to work.
- `JAVA` produces bytecode which is machine independent as machines have machine-specific JVM available.
- `Python` is an interpreted Language and runs/executes code line by line and generates output for each line and then looks at the next line.
- `Javascript` is a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented multi-paradigm, interpreted or JIT compiles, dynamic single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model., more close to python in some sense.

## Datatypes in C++

- int
- char
- long
- float
- double
- char\*
- long long =  long = long long int
- unsigned, signed
- bool

## Type conversion

- C way
  - (double)x / y
  - blindly typecasts

- C++ way
  - static_cast<double\> $x / y$
	- only typecasts if possible, otherwise it throws an error.

## Precedence

> Trick: `PUMA'S REBL TAC`

- Parenthesis `()`,`[]`,`{}`
- Unary `+`,`-`,`++`,`--`,`*`(deref) , `&`(ref)
  - Postfix operator has higher precedence over deref or Prefix operator.
- Multiplicative `*`, `/`
- Addition `+`,`-`
- Shift `>>`, `<<`
- Relational `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Equality `=`
- Binary `&`,`|`, `~`
- Logical `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Ternary `?:`
- Assignment `=`, `+=`
- Comma `,`

## Associativity

> Trick : `AUT`
- Only these are Right to left Associative
	- Ternary
	- Unary
	- Assignment
- Rest of them are L to R.

## Array and its various ways of declaration.

```cpp
// = sign may be ommitted here
int arr[] = {1,2,3};
int arr[4] = {1,2,3,4}
int arr[10]; // each elements have garbage value
int arr[10] = {} // Imp: set all elements to 0
int arr[10] = {0} // first to zero and rest to zero
int arr[10] = {9} // Imp: first to nine and rest to zero

// 2d array
int arr[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
// no of rows are optional but no. of columns are compulsory.
int arr[][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
int arr[][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};
char words[2][10] = {"shaurya", "singhal"} // valid
```

:::caution

- No index out of bound Checking in c++. ðŸ˜­
- The C++ runtime does not perform bounds checking on array indices, so if an array named arr is declared of size 33 and you try to access arr[5], there is no telling what will happen. The program might crash due to a segmentation fault, or it might keep running while giving potentially incorrect results.
- Arrays are always passed as pointers to functions and length cannot be determined using `sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])` inside function, therefore have to pass the length of the array as an argument to the function.
- Provides cache spatial locality of reference as arrays are stored continuously.
- Have to know the size before we create them. Solution: Vector.
- counting int array will give you the address of the first integer, whereas counting char array will print all characters till null character.

```cpp
	int arr[10] = {1,2,3};
	char ch_arr[10] = {'1','2','3', '\0'};
	cout<<arr<<endl; // print address of 1(arr[0])
	cout<<ch_arr<<endl; // print "123".
```
:::

## References in C++

- Creates an alias.
- Must be assigned when declared.
- Cannot refer to another location.
- Cannot be null.
- **Avoid copying larger objects during function calls.**
- **Helps in modifying the passed parameters to function.**

## Pointers in C++

- Can be assigned later.
- Can refer to another location.
- Can be null.
- **Avoid copying larger objects during function calls.**
- **Helps in modifying the passed parameters to function.**
- helps in returning multiple values. (just pass variables as a pointer as arguments to a function and assign return values to them).
- Helps in Dynamic Memory Allocation.
- In Implementing Data structures.
- `*` and `++` are both unary operators and have right-to-left associativity.
- Subtraction b/w pointers (p1-p2) is possible if both points to the same array and p1>=p2.
- Addition, multiplication, and division are not feasible on pointers.

## Pointers and Array

```cpp
	arr[0] is same as *(arr+0) = 0[arr]
	arr[2][1] is same as *(*(arr+2)+1) = 2[arr][1]
```
---

```cpp
	int marks[] = {10,20,30};
	int* p = marks;

	cout<<marks // addresss of marks[0] = 0x7ffe6fdb5170
	cout<<p // addresss of marks[0] = 0x7ffe6fdb5170

	cout<<&marks // addresss of marks[0] = 0x7ffe6fdb5170
	cout<<&p // addresss of pointer variable p = 0x7ffe6fdb5168

	// ***** Imporant
	cout<<sizeof(marks) // 3*4 = 12
	cout<<sizeof(p) // 4

	cout<< marks++ // error
	cout<< ++p // address of marks[1]

	p =  marks // valid
	marks = p // error

	// this concept is differnt for character/char array(i.e. char*)
	char val='A';
	cout<<&val<<endl; // prints A rather than adress of A, 
	// it is because of operator overloading of <<, 
	// we can still print adress of char using typecasting of char adress (char*) to void*
	cout<<(void*) &val <<endl; // prints address here.
```

## 2d Array

- **Using Static memory Allocation**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  const int row = 2, col = 2;
  // static array initialization
  int staticArr[row][col] = { {1, 2}, {3, 4}};
  cout << "Static two-dimensional array: ";
  for(int i=0; i<row; i++)
    for(int j=0; j<col; j++)
      cout << staticArr[i][j] << " ";
  cout << endl;
```

- **Using Dynamic memory Allocation**

```cpp
	// 2d array of size (10,20) + taking input in it
	int row =10, col=20;
	int* arr = new int*[row];
	for(int i=0; i<row; i++){
		arr[i] = new int[col];
		for(int j=0; j<col; j++){
			cin>>arr[i][j];
		}
	}

	// print
	for(int i=0; i<row; i++){
		for(int j=0; j<col; j++){
			cout<<arr[i][j]<<" ";
		}
		cout<<endl;
	}

	// deletion
	for(int i=0; i<row; i++){
		delete [] arr[i];
	}
	delete [] arr;
```

- Can be stored in memory in 
	- Row Major Order (RMO) 
	- Store continuously row-wise 
	- Column Major Order (CMO) 
	- Store continuously col wise

## Pairs with automatic destructuring

```cpp

	vector<pair<int, bool>> vp;

	vp.push_back(make_pair(2,true));
	vp.push_back({3,false}); // automatci destructuring
	vp.push_back({4,false});
	vp.push_back({5,true});

	for(auto x: vp){
		cout << vp.first << " " << vp.second <<endl;
	}

	// auto Destructing - GOOD
	for(auto [a,b]: vp){
		cout << a << " " << b <<endl;
	}

```

## Recursion on array and strings

- on Array,

	- doing `a + 1`, reduces size by 1, or take an index variable to indicate the starting point of the array. 
	- Note in character array if the array is empty then at index 0,  we will have null '\0'.

		`````cpp
		char str[100];
		bool isTrue = str[0]=='\0'; // true aayega
		```
	- check length of character array using s[i]!='\0'

		````cpp
		for(int i=0; s[i]!='\0'; i++){/* Do some work */}
		```

- on String
	- do `str.substr(index)` or take a index variable to indicate the starting point of string.
	- Note in string as well if string is empty `""` then at index 0 we will have null '\0'.

## Global variables in C++

- variables declared outside any function, even main() are accessed by anyone, any function, any class and hence are called global variables.
- Should not use as it breaks the [`PURE function`](https://blog.greenroots.info/what-are-pure-functions-and-side-effects-in-javascript) concept of the functional programming paradigm.

## C-string

- C string is a 1D character array and is terminated by null character '\0'

```cpp
	// Note: cout<<(address of char array a) -> prints value till found '\0'.
	// Note: cout<<(address of int array a) -> prints address..
	char name[] = {'s', 'h', 'a', 'u', 'r', 'y', 'a'}
	cout<<name; // will print name array complete. // may have a problem, so always put null character if declaring this way.
	char name[] = {'s', 'h', 'a', 'u', 'r', 'y', 'a', '\0'}; // recommended
	cout<<name; // more predictable or else do like
	char name[] ="shaurya" // complier will automatically add '\0'


```

- Utility function to work with cstring are available in `<cstring>` like
```cpp
  1. strcpy(s1,s2)
  2. strcmp(s1,s2)
  3. strcat(s1,s2)
  4. strlen(s1)
  5. strch(s1,ch) // returns pointer to ch in s1
  6. strstr(s1,"sub") // return substring `sub` reference
```

## C++ String

- C++ string is builtin on top of cstring and is a string class that stores characters as a sequence of bytes.
- Memory is allocated dynamically (no need to get the length of the string first).
- available in `#include<string>`
- take input via cin (till whitespace)
- use `getline(cin, variable)` to get the complete line as input

- **Imp: Appending characters/string to a string**
	```cpp
		`s += "something" // O(1) as no new string is created.` 
		// Why? as internally it is implemented as character arr/vector and doing `+=` is like doing vector.push_back(), that's why string have push_back()/pop_back() method
		`s = s + "something" // O(n) as here new string is created.`
	```

- Checking if a character exists in a string or not. 
- return `str.find(ch) != string::npos`

-	#### `str.method()`

```cpp
	- member functions
		- constructor()
		- destructor()
		- operator = ()

	- Iterator
		- begin() // important
		- end() // important
		- rbegin()
		- rend()

	- Capacity
		- capacity()
		- size() // important
		- length() // important
		- resize()
		- max_size()
		- clear()

	- element access
		- using indexing str[i], operator []() // important
		- at()
		- back() // get last item but does not pop it
		- front()

	- modifiers
		- operator +=() // with other variations <=, < ,> ...
		- append()
		- push_back()
		- pop_back() // only pops it does not return the popped value.
		- assign()
		- erase()
		- replace()

	- other
		- c_str() // get cstring from c++ string
		- substr(begin_index, length_of_substring) // **important
		- compare()
		- copy(chararray, length, position)
		- swap()
		- find(substring) // returns first occurence of substring
		- rfind(substring) // returns last occurence of substring
		- find_first_of(string) // returns first occurence of any character in string
		- find_last_of(string)
		- insert(position, string_to_insert)
```

- `char + char = int`
- `char - char = int`
- `int + int = int` 
- `int - int = int`
- `int / int = int`
- `int * int = int`
- `int + double= double`
- `int - double = double`
- `int / double = double` 
- `double / int = double`
- `double / double = double`
- `double * int = double`

## cin vs cin.getline()

- getline also takes space b/w values as one entity. 
- same as input() in python.

```cpp
	// cin.getline(arr, maxsize, [delimiter]) // default delimiter='\n'
	char para[1000];
	cin.getline(para, 1000);
	cin.getline(para, 1000, ' '); // becomes cin
	cin.getline(para, 1000, '.'); // keep taking at max 1000 chars or till you got .
```

## cin.get()

- can read chars including tabs('\t'), whitespace, `;` , `,` or other special characters.

## getline(cin, str)

- only for taking string as input in str

## typedefs

```cpp
	typedef long long int ll
	typedef unsigned long int ull
```

```cpp
	// *** Testing long
	cout<<sizeof(long long)<<endl; // 8
	cout<<sizeof(long long int)<<endl; //8
	cout<<sizeof(long)<<endl; //8
```

```cpp

	string str = "shaurya";
	string::iterator it;

	for(auto it = str.begin(); it != str.end(); it++){
		cout<<*it<<" ";
	}

	string::reverse_iterator it;

	for(auto rit = str.rbegin(); rit != str.rend(); rit++){
		cout<<*rit<<" ";
	}
```

## struct vs class

- Use struct to bundle multiple items together.
- Everything is `public by default in struct` and `private by default in class`. Else everything is the same!
- when in a hurry use struct or pair(why? because, the default public).

  ```cpp
  struct Pair{
  	int first;
  	int second;
  };

  Pair p;
  p.first = 1;
  p.second = 2;
  // or Pair p = {1, 2}
  // or Pair p{1, 2}
  // or change order using : Pair p = {.second = 1, .first= 2} called dedicated Initialization.
  cout<<p.first<<" " << p.second<<endl;
  // Note
  Pair *ptr = &p;
  (*ptr).first = 4
  // or
  ptr->second = 5
  ```

## Dynamic Memory Allocation via new

- operator **new**
  - returns the pointer to the memory allocated.
  - always used for dynamic memory allocation.
  - calls the constructor for objects of class or struct
  

## OOPS

- Use when we have many entities like working with database(models), making banking software, designing bank system etc.
- **Concepts**
  - Class
  - Object
  - Abstraction (APIs)
  - Data Hiding (Access Modifiers)
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
  - Inheritance, Composition.
	- 4 different special functions that are always available in a class
		- Constructor
		- Destructor
		- Copy Constructor
		- Copy assignment operator

## Polymorphism
- Compile Time Polymorphism (static/early Binding)
  - `Function overloading`
  - `Operator overloading`
  - `Default Arguments`
- Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic/late Binding)
  - `Function overriding
  - `Operator overriding
  - `virtual functions`: so to call function based on the object rather than pointer.(A way to achieve function overriding).
  - Happens when we have a **baseclass pointer pointing to a subclass object. (Vehicle\* v = new car)**, btw vice-versa is not possible.
  - let both Vehicle and Car have a print function.
  - v -> print() will call vehicles print, not car prints.
  - but if we make function in the vehicle virtual then the car's print will be called.
  - Why? let employee is a baseclass and teacher, gardener, manager are baseclasses and each(base and sub) have a calculatesalary method. we want to store all salaries of different employees in an array.
  - since the array can only hold homogeneous values. we have to use `Employee* salaries[100]` we can push each object of base classes into it. and call calculatesalary() in a loop. it works only if calculatesalary is virtual in baseclass.

## Passing function to a function in cpp

- pass bool (&fun)(int a, int b) as a parameter. It is a declaration of function + wrapping function name in braces. & is to avoid copy.

```cpp
	// look last parameter
	void sortByMe(int*arr, int*arrend, bool (&fun)(int a, int b))

	bool cmp(int a, int b){
		return a<b;
	}

	sortByMe(arr,arr+n, cmp)
```

- Example 2

```cpp
void wrapper(void (&gift)()){
	cout<<"wrapper"<<endl;
	gift();
}

void first_class_function(){
	cout<<"first class function"<<endl;
}

int32_t main(){
	fastIO();
	/** code here */
	wrapper(first_class_function);
	return 0;
}
```

## Questions answered!

- What is **Amortized Analysis**?
  - Ans: Analysing the complexity approximately that if work is equally distributed, what is the work each one is doing. - Actual time complexity is sum of all subtasks, some of them is big & some is small but when you some them it is averaged out. - 1,1,1,1,n,1,1,1,1,n,1,1,1,1 = (2n+12)/n = O(1) - 1,2,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 = can be seen as each of them is doing 1.5 work rather than some 1 some 4,8,16. This is Amortized.

- Use of tail recursion in compiler or how it optimizes the performance ? - add goto statement and change parameter explicitely and make instruction jump to start. - ex1: print n natural numbers
  `cpp // tail recursion void printNNumbers(int n){ if(n<0){ return; } cout<<n<<" "; return printNNumbers(n-1); }`

      	```cpp
      	// Tail Recursion after Optimization (TRO)
      	// Done Automatically by Compilers in Compiler's Code Optimization phase
      	// Avoid adding a new entry to call Stack.
      	// Avoid call registration, CALL/JUMP and RETURN Function instructions.
      	// Converting call stack calls(recursive calls) to iterative
      	// Hence optimizing performance

      	void printNNumbers(int n){
      		label comeback:
      		if(n<0){
      			return;
      		}
      		cout<<n<<" ";
      		n = n-1;
      		goto comeback ;
      	}
      	```

      	- ex2: calculation of factorial

      	```cpp
      	// not-tail recursion  (head recursion)
      	// Why? Because after the recurion is done, I still have operations to perform, multiply by n here.
      	int fact(int n){
      		if(n==0){
      			return 1;
      		}
      		return n * fact(n-1);
      	}
      	```

      	```cpp
      	// tail recursion
      	void fact(int n, int &ans){
      		if(n == 0){
      			ans = 1
      			return;
      		}
      		ans = ans * n;
      		fact(n-1, ans);
      	}

      	int fact(int n){
      		int ans = 1;
      		factHelper(n, ans);
      		return ans;
      	}
      	```

      	```cpp
      	// Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO)
      	void factHelper(int n, int &ans){
      		label comeback:
      		if(n == 0){
      			ans = 1
      			return;
      		}
      		ans = ans * n;
      		n = n-1;
      		goto comeback ;
      	}
      	int fact(int n){
      		int ans = 1;
      		factHelper(n, ans);
      		return ans;
      	}
      	```

## C++11 features

- Anonymous functions(return type will be inferred as `bool` by the compiler)

```cpp
sort(a, a+n, [] (Student s1, Student s2) {
		return s1.name<s2.name
});
```

## String Tokenization in C++

```cpp

string input;
getline(cin, input);

isstream is(input); 
string token;
while(getline(is, token, ' ')){
	token.push_back(token);
}

```
## Questions to be answered!

- NP Hard Problems?

- expansion of logn is a harmonic sum of the first n natural number(1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+...)?
